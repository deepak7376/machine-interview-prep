Dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing their solutions and reusing them to avoid redundant calculations. It is particularly useful when you have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties in your problem.

Here's a high-level explanation of how dynamic programming works with Python:

1. Define the problem: Start by understanding the problem you want to solve. Determine if it exhibits the following characteristics:

   a. Overlapping Subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved independently, and these subproblems may overlap or be solved multiple times.

   b. Optimal Substructure: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

2. Choose a data structure: Decide how you will store and retrieve the solutions to subproblems. Common choices include arrays, matrices, dictionaries, or lists.

3. Recurrence relation: Define a recurrence relation that expresses the solution to a problem in terms of the solutions to its smaller subproblems. This relation should be based on the optimal substructure of the problem.

4. Memoization (Top-Down Approach): Create a function that uses recursion to solve the problem by breaking it into subproblems. However, before solving a subproblem, check if its solution has already been computed and stored. If so, retrieve the stored solution; otherwise, compute and store it. This technique is called memoization.

   Here's a basic example in Python using memoization to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:

   ```python
   def fib(n, memo={}):
       if n in memo:
           return memo[n]
       if n <= 2:
           return 1
       memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo)
       return memo[n]
   ```

5. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach): Alternatively, you can use a bottom-up approach to solve the problem by iteratively filling a table (usually an array or a matrix) with solutions to subproblems. Start with the base cases and build up to the final problem.

   Here's a Python example for calculating the nth Fibonacci number using tabulation:

   ```python
   def fib(n):
       if n <= 2:
           return 1
       fib_table = [0] * (n + 1)
       fib_table[1] = fib_table[2] = 1
       for i in range(3, n + 1):
           fib_table[i] = fib_table[i - 1] + fib_table[i - 2]
       return fib_table[n]
   ```

6. Return the final solution: In both the memoization and tabulation approaches, you will eventually have the solution to the original problem, which you can return as the final result.

Dynamic programming is a versatile technique that can be applied to various problems, such as the Fibonacci sequence, shortest path problems, and many more. The choice between memoization and tabulation often depends on the specific problem and your coding style preferences.
