Recursion is a programming concept in which a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It's a powerful technique that's often used in algorithms and programming to break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable subproblems. Understanding recursion and visualizing it can be challenging, but I'll explain it in a simple way and provide examples.

**Recursion Basics:**

Recursion involves two main parts:

1. **Base Case**: This is the simplest scenario in which the function can directly provide a result without making a recursive call. It serves as the exit condition for the recursion.

2. **Recursive Case**: In this part, the function calls itself with a modified input to solve a smaller or simpler subproblem. This process continues until the base case is reached.

**Visualization of Recursion:**

To visualize recursion, think of it as a set of nested Russian dolls, where each doll contains a smaller one inside. You start with the outermost doll and progressively open each one until you reach the innermost doll. In the context of a function, each function call creates a new "frame" or "scope" of the function, and these frames are stacked on top of each other like the Russian dolls.

Here's an example that illustrates recursion and how it works:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: If n is 0 or 1, return 1.
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: Call the function with a smaller input (n-1).
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Now, let's visualize the recursive calls for `factorial(4)`:

1. `factorial(4)` calls `factorial(3)` - You open a new doll with `n=3`.
2. `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)` - You open a new doll with `n=2`.
3. `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)` - You open a new doll with `n=1`.
4. `factorial(1)` returns 1 - You've reached the innermost doll (base case).
5. `factorial(2)` multiplies 1 by 2 and returns 2.
6. `factorial(3)` multiplies 2 by 3 and returns 6.
7. `factorial(4)` multiplies 6 by 4 and returns 24.

In this example, each function call opens a new frame, and the recursive calls continue until the base case is reached. Once the base case is reached, the results are calculated and propagated back up the call stack.

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science, and it's used to solve problems like searching trees, traversing graphs, and dividing complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. Understanding the base case, recursive case, and the call stack is crucial when working with recursion.
