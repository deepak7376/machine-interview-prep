## Regularization

It is a technique used to address the overfitting problem in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.

### Types of Regularization:

1. **L1/L2 Regularization:**
   - **L1 norm (Lasso):** It penalizes the model using the summation of all the model weights.
     \[ L1 = \lambda \cdot |W| \]

   - **L2 norm (Ridge):** Similar to L1, it penalizes the model based on the summation of squared model weights.
     \[ L2 = \lambda \cdot |W|^2 \]

2. **Dropout:**
   - Dropout is a regularization technique specifically used in neural networks. It randomly drops (sets to zero) a fraction of the input units during training, which helps prevent overfitting.

3. **Early Stopping:**
   - Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping the training process once the performance starts to degrade. This helps prevent the model from learning noise in the training data.

4. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying various transformations (such as rotation, scaling, or flipping) to the existing training data. This helps increase the diversity of the training set and improves the model's ability to generalize.

Regularization techniques aim to find the right balance between fitting the training data well and avoiding overfitting. They are essential tools in building robust and generalizable machine learning models.
