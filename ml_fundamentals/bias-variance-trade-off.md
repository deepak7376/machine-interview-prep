## Bias Variance Trade-off
Training a machine learning model can be a challenging task, for better accuracy we need to focus on train loss as well as val loss.

if train loss is less and val loss is higher ==> high variance model (overfitting)
train loss is higher and val loss is high ==> high bias model (underfitting)

we need to find the sweet spot between underfit and overfit
