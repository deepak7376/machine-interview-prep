### Open-Ended Questions (3):
1. **Discuss the impact of feature selection on model performance. How do different feature selection techniques work, and what factors would influence your choice of a particular technique in a given scenario?**

2. **Explore the challenges and strategies for handling missing data in a machine learning dataset. How can the choice of imputation methods affect model outcomes, and what considerations should be taken into account when deciding on the most suitable approach?**

3. **Examine the role of ensemble methods in machine learning. Provide an overview of popular ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting, and explain how they can be used to improve model accuracy and robustness.**


### Case-Study (1):
4. **Consider a scenario where you are tasked with building a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. Outline the key components of the system, the data sources required, and the evaluation metrics you would use to assess its effectiveness.**

### Coding (5):

5. **Write a Python function to implement k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification. Provide insights into how the choice of the 'k' parameter can impact the model's performance.**

6. **Develop a binary classification model using logistic regression in Python. Discuss how you would handle categorical features, regularization, and model evaluation metrics.**

7. **Implement a basic neural network with one hidden layer using a deep learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Explain the purpose of the activation functions and how backpropagation is applied in the training process.**
