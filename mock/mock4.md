1. **Question: Model Selection and Evaluation**

   *Scenario:* Imagine you're tasked with solving a classification problem for a company that collects data on user behavior for an e-commerce website. You have a dataset with features like user demographics, browsing history, and purchase patterns. How would you approach the task of selecting and evaluating a machine learning model for this problem? Walk me through the steps you would take, from data exploration to model deployment. Additionally, discuss the factors that might influence your choice of a specific model and how you would measure the model's performance.

2. **Question: Overfitting and Regularization**

   *Scenario:* Suppose you've built a machine learning model for predicting stock prices using a historical dataset. During testing, you notice that the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. How would you diagnose the issue of overfitting, and what techniques or regularization methods would you consider to address this problem? Explain the concept of overfitting, why it occurs, and how regularization can help. Provide examples of regularization techniques commonly used in machine learning, and discuss their impact on the model's performance.

3. **Question: Data Preprocessing in Python**

   *Scenario:* Assume you have a large dataset in CSV format containing missing values, categorical features, and outliers. As a machine learning engineer, you need to preprocess the data before training a predictive model. Write a Python script to perform the necessary data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and addressing outliers. Explain each step in your script, and discuss any libraries or functions you would use to accomplish these tasks. Additionally, highlight the importance of each preprocessing step in the context of machine learning and how it contributes to the overall model performance.
