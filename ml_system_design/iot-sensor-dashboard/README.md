I can provide you with a textual representation of the architecture for your IoT Sensor Data Dashboard using Flask, Redis, MQTT, and Docker Compose:

```

```

In this architectural representation:

- The "Flask Web Server" serves as the user interface for the IoT Sensor Data Dashboard.
- The "Redis Data Store" stores real-time sensor data for the dashboard.
- The "MQTT Broker" facilitates communication between the Flask app and the IoT device simulations (workers).
- Two "Worker (IoT Publisher)" processes simulate IoT devices, publishing sensor data to the MQTT broker.
- Docker Compose orchestrates and manages these components to ensure they work together smoothly.
